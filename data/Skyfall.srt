1
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:26,111
Ronson's down.

2
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,728
He needs a medical evac.

3
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,322
Where is it? Is it there?

4
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:32,653
- Oh, the drive is gone.
- Are you sure?

5
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,514
It's gone. Give me a minute.

6
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,845
They must have it.
Get after them.

7
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:47,879
- I'm stabilising Ronson.
- We don't have the time.

8
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,087
- I have to stop the bleeding.
- Leave him!

9
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,666
Have you got him?

10
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:29,957
He is in the black Audi.

11
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,930
- What about Ronson.
- He's been hit.

12
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,701
I'm sending an emergency
evacuation squad.

13
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,060
Well, that'll be too bloody late.

14
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,131
Have they seen us?

15
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:43,373
Medical Evac for Ronson,
five minutes way.

16
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,921
It's allright?
You'll wait using it.

17
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,390
I wasn't using that one either.

18
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:41,605
Keep your head down!

19
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,628
Just get clear!

20
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:20,921
Tanner, which way?

21
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,912
Keep going.
I can direct you from here.

22
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,231
We both know
what's at stake here.

23
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,407
We can not afford
to lose that list.

24
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:27,775
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,283
Where are they now?

26
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:01,240
They're on the rooftop
of the grand bazaar.

27
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:55,675
Take the left, there's a bridge.
You can cut him off.

28
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,723
- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma' am.

29
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:50,687
What do you mean on the train?

30
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,249
I mean they're on the top
of the train.

31
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,455
Well, get after them,
for God's sake.

32
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,370
He's going out of range.

33
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:26,944
We've lost tracking.
We are blind here.

34
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,711
- What's going on?
- I'm still with them.

35
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:31,263
Getting CCTV satellite,
end of question.

36
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,358
What was that?

37
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:26,108
VW Beetle, I think.

38
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,172
He's uncoupling the cars.

39
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:35,489
- 007, are you alright?
- Just changing carriages.

40
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,494
What's going on? Report!

41
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,475
It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.

42
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:43,037
007 is saying proceed.

43
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,932
This side here isn't much more road.
I do not think I can go any further.

44
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,711
I may have a shot.

45
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,536
It's not clean.

46
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,231
Repeat.
I did not have a clean shot.

47
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,109
There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm gonna lose them.

48
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:50,490
- Can you get into a better position?
- Negative. There's no time.

49
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:53,550
Take the shot.

50
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,193
I said, "Take the shot!"

51
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,519
Well, I can't. I may get Bond.

52
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,262
Take the bloody shot.

53
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,358
Agent down.

54
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,285
It's like going
into the headmaster study.

55
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:49,540
It's new chairman's
just a standard procedure.

56
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:52,243
Bloody waste of my time,
that's what I'd call it.

57
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,174
I'm sorry to have
to deal with such...

58
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:56,051
a delicate subject
at our first encounter...

59
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,225
But...

60
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:03,315
I have to be frank with you.

61
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,647
And that would be a good idea.

62
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:09,648
The Prime Minister
is concerned.

63
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,657
You can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.

64
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:15,501
Have you considered
pulling up the agents?

65
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:16,987
I've considered every option.

66
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,259
Forgive me,
but that sounds like an evasion.

67
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,618
Forgive me, but why am I here?

68
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:25,590
Three months ago
you lost the computer drive

69
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:28,526
containing the identity
of almost every NATO agent

70
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,924
embedded in terrorist organisations
across the globe.

71
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:34,652
A list which,
in the eyes of our allies,

72
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:35,922
never existed.

73
00:18:35,972 --> 00:18:39,522
So, if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why you're here.

74
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,347
How you should call it,
a civilian oversight?

75
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:43,483
No, what we call this is...

76
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,657
a retirement planning.

77
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:49,000
Your country has only
the highest respect for you

78
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,021
and your many years of service.

79
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:52,686
When your current posting
is completed,

80
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:55,070
you'll be awarded to GCMG

81
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:56,796
with full honors.

82
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:59,477
Congratulations.

83
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,489
You're firing me?

84
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,634
No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period...

85
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,877
leading to your voluntary retirement
in two months' time.

86
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,413
Your successor has yet to be appointed,
so we'll be asking you...

87
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm not an idiot, Mallory.

88
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,831
I know I can't do this job
forever.

89
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:16,336
But I'll be damned if I'm going
to leave the department

90
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,509
in worst shape than I found it.

91
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:21,415
M... you've had a great run.

92
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:24,834
- You should leave with dignity.
- Oh to hell with dignity.

93
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:28,670
I'll leave when the job's done.

94
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:46,732
Yes?

95
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,043
Now?

96
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,015
Main alert from Q Robson,

97
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,703
trying to decrypt
the stolen hard drive.

98
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:58,417
We are tracing
the encryption signal.

99
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,031
Localising now.

100
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:05,676
It's sent here in the UK.

101
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:07,567
London.

102
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,399
Get to inspect the basis
as soon as possible.

103
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:19,409
- It's coming from MI6.
- What?

104
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:22,448
The data back,
it is linking to our network.

105
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,968
Corrupted.
This is behind our firewall.

106
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,766
- We should shut down.
- No, track it.

107
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,473
We have to know
where it's coming from.

108
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:32,005
Strip the head
and try the source.

109
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:33,898
How the hell
it entered in our system?

110
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:36,110
Getting a trace right now.

111
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:46,687
- It is your computer, ma'am.
- Shut it down.

112
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,211
What is this?

113
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:17,257
For God's sake!

114
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:20,194
Just get out of the way.

115
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:22,967
- Don't you recognise the car?
- Madam...

116
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:55,972
This is BBC breaking news.

117
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:06,437
In what now appears to be a major
terrorist attack, in the heart of London.

118
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,860
No one has yet claimed responsibility, for
what sources are calling.

119
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:14,308
A possible Cyber-Terrorist attack, on the
British Secret Service.

120
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:18,583
Early reports from the scene, indicate at
least 6 dead.

121
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:23,174
Many more injured, with victims being
evacuated to local Hospitals.

122
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,015
Within minutes of the explosion

123
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:50,648
I'm going to find
who ever did this.

124
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:41,449
Where the hell have you been?

125
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:45,255
Enjoying death.

126
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:48,785
007, reporting for duty.

127
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,416
Why didn't you call?

128
00:25:57,992 --> 00:25:59,126
Didn't you get the postcard?

129
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,191
You should try it sometimes.

130
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:04,128
Get away from it all,
it really lends perspective.

131
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:06,855
Run out of drink.
Were you awarded, eh?

132
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:07,948
What it was you said?

133
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,516
Take the bloody shot.

134
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:12,528
I made a judgement call.

135
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:15,004
You should have trusted me
to finish the job.

136
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:16,481
It was the possibility
of losing you...

137
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:19,520
or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

138
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,452
I made the only decision I could
and you know it.

139
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,859
I think you've lost your nerve.

140
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,271
What do you expect,
a bloody apology?

141
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,816
You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.

142
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,366
- We both have.
- Maybe too long.

143
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:38,662
Speak for yourself.

144
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:40,974
Ronson didn't make it, did he?

145
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,277
No.

146
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:47,749
So, this is it.

147
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,001
We're both played out.

148
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,895
Well, if you believed that,
why did you come back?

149
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,429
Good question.

150
00:26:57,188 --> 00:26:58,701
Because we are under attack...

151
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,799
and you know we need you.

152
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:08,527
Well, I'm here.

153
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,369
You'll have to be debriefed...

154
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,310
and declared fit
for active service.

155
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,401
You're gonna return to duty
when you've passed the tests.

156
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:18,643
So take them seriously.

157
00:27:19,747 --> 00:27:21,717
The shower might be an order.

158
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:24,747
I'm going home and change.

159
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,184
Oh, we sold your flat.

160
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,622
Put your things into storage.

161
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:30,637
Standard procedure...

162
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,207
on the death of an unmarried
employee with no next of kin.

163
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,740
You should have called.

164
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,360
I'll find a hotel.

165
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,997
Well, you're bloody
will not sleep in here.

166
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,827
They attacked into the
environmental control system

167
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:15,095
locked out the safety protocols
and have turned on the gas.

168
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:16,930
Well, that should
have been impossible.

169
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:19,528
I was told that they have hacked
into our files.

170
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,911
They knew her appointments.

171
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,165
They knew she would be
out of the building.

172
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:24,530
They weren't targeting her.

173
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,544
They wanted us to see it.

174
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:32,076
- Where are we, lieutenant?
- New digs.

175
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,558
The old building was declared
strategically vulnerable.

176
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,830
That's putting it mildly.

177
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:48,186
Their aim is to breach the most secured
computer system in Britain.

178
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,568
So we are at war with them now.

179
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:53,421
This is part of Churchill's bunker.

180
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:56,368
Some of these tunnels
are dating back to the 18th century.

181
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:58,729
Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.

182
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:01,576
- When do I see M?
- Tomorrow, you'll see M...

183
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,544
and Mallory too
if you're lucky.

184
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,233
Who is Mallory?

185
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,466
The new chairman of the
Intelligence and Security Committee.

186
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,754
A charming man, I think.
You and him will really gonna hit it off.

187
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,886
Welcome to the new MI6.

188
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:33,851
We've have attempted to trace
the computer message, but...

189
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:37,152
it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm...

190
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,036
with the chance to signal
all over the globe

191
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:41,279
through thousands
of different servers.

192
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,750
And now that they've accessed
M's code,

193
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,555
it's only a matter of time before
they are able to decrypt the list.

194
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:49,019
Q branch has been analysing pictures.,
But so far, nothing.

195
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:51,372
General feeling it's probably
something from her past.

196
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,873
Perhaps when she was
running things in Hong Kong.

197
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:57,606
- It is no idea what it all means?
- And you believe that?

198
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:00,684
The truth is we don't have
a clue of what's on the list...

199
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:03,864
or what they are trying
to do with it.

200
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:11,613
We can always do this later.

201
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:15,314
You know what? Let's.

202
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:24,423
I'd like to start with some
simple words' sensations.

203
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:27,107
Just tell me the first word
that punch into your head.

204
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,567
For example I might day,
and you might say...

205
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,593
Wasted.

206
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,985
All right.

207
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,331
Gun.

208
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:44,062
Shot.

209
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,150
- Agent.
- Provocative.

210
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,596
- Woman.
- Provocatrix.

211
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,725
- Heart.
- Target.

212
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,616
- Bird.
- Sky.

213
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,922
- M.
- Bitch.

214
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:01,962
- Sunlight.
- Swim.

215
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:03,699
- Moonlight.
- Dance.

216
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:06,688
- Murder.
- Employment.

217
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,662
- Country.
- England.

218
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:10,680
Skyfall.

219
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,404
Skyfall.

220
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,977
Done.

221
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,124
This is going well.

222
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,228
Get these analysed.

223
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,366
When arrives, on me.

224
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,533
She's ready for you.

225
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,017
I'm sorry. Have we met before?

226
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:57,318
I am the one
who should say "sorry".

227
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:01,346
It was only four ribs.

228
00:34:02,062 --> 00:34:03,938
There's nonetheless
vital organs.

229
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,952
Nothing major.

230
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:14,544
No enough excitement
in Istanbul?

231
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,042
I've been reassigned.

232
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:18,407
Temporary suspension
from field work.

233
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,742
- Really?
- Something to do with killing 007.

234
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,574
- Well, you gave it your best shot.
- It was hardly my best shot.

235
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,946
I'm sure
I can survive your best.

236
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,134
Time you'll get the chance.

237
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,487
Would you do me a favor,
will you?

238
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:33,619
If they'll do let you back
out there...

239
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,740
Warn me first.

240
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:39,543
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition...

241
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:41,795
and then I'll be back
in the field.

242
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,538
- That's what you want?
- Yes, of course.

243
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:47,814
- This is not for everyone.
- Ah, 007...

244
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:49,986
It's this way.

245
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:51,570
In your defense...

246
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:54,615
a moving target
is much harder to hit.

247
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:59,011
Then you better keep moving.

248
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:12,857
The whole office goes off in smoke
and that bloody thing survives.

249
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:17,274
Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.

250
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:19,889
007, Gareth Mallory.

251
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:23,340
I hope I haven't miss anything,
the P.M. does prattle on in a crisis.

252
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:26,046
- Bond.
- Mallory.

253
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:33,040
I have just been reviewing
Bond's tests.

254
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,882
Seems you've passed.
By the skin of your teeth.

255
00:35:37,374 --> 00:35:38,934
You're back on active service.

256
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:42,799
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

257
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:47,031
- I'll be outside.
- I only have one question.

258
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,037
Why not stay dead?

259
00:35:51,788 --> 00:35:53,508
You had the perfect way out.

260
00:35:53,558 --> 00:35:55,229
Go and live quietly somewhere.

261
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:59,155
Not many field agents get to leave this cleanly.

262
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,110
Do you get out in the field much?

263
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,724
You don't need to be an operative
to see the obvious.

264
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,824
It's a young men's game.

265
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:10,378
Look, you've been seriously injured.

266
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,930
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

267
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:16,166
The only shame, it would be is
not admitting it until it's too late.

268
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:20,794
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

269
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:22,964
If he says he's ready,
he's ready.

270
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:26,293
Perhaps you can't see at all.

271
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:27,122
Maybe you will.

272
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:28,816
What exactly are you implying?

273
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:31,193
You are sentimental about him.

274
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:33,887
As long as I am the head
of this department,

275
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:36,536
I'll choose my own operatives.

276
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,778
Fair enough.

277
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,592
Good luck, 007.

278
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,125
Don't cock it up.

279
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:57,751
We've analysed the shrapnel fragments.

280
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,611
You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit.
It would have cut you in half.

281
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,962
It's a depleted uranium shell. 
Military grade.

282
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,981
Hard to get,
extremely expensive

283
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:11,750
and only used by a select few.

284
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,192
Recognise anyone?

285
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,226
Him.

286
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,324
Okay, the name's Patrice.

287
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,347
He's a ghost.

288
00:37:20,397 --> 00:37:22,225
No known residence,
or country of origin.

289
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:23,818
So how do we find him?

290
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:27,154
Well, luckily we still have one
or two friends left in the CIA.

291
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:30,060
They're after him for the Yemeni
ambassador's murder.

292
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,343
And they're getting close.

293
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:35,425
Intel is he's gonna be in Shanghai
in two days time. Probably on a job.

294
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:38,005
You're to go there
and await further instructions.

295
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,030
If he turns up, he's yours.

296
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,345
Find out who he worked for
and who has the list.

297
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:47,134
- Then, terminate him for Ronson.
- With pleasure.

298
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:51,367
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

299
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,788
No.

300
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,703
Report to the new quarter master
for your documentation.

301
00:37:57,043 --> 00:38:00,606
He hasn't set up shop yet, but
Tanner will put you two together.

302
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,782
Good luck.

303
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:03,552
Thank you.

304
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,571
007...

305
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:12,197
You are ready for this?

306
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,797
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:19,967
I didn't know
Bond passed the tests.

308
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,750
He didn't.

309
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:54,297
Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.

310
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,964
A grand old warship being
ignominiously hauled away for scrap.

311
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,420
Inevitabilty of time,
don't you think?

312
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:08,127
What do you see?

313
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,784
A bloody big ship.

314
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,156
Excuse me.

315
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:15,784
007...

316
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,695
I'm your new Quarter master.

317
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,480
You must be joking.

318
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:24,952
Why, because I'm not wearing
a lab coat?

319
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,428
Because you still have spots.

320
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:29,971
My complexion
is hardly relevant.

321
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:31,459
And your confidence is.

322
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:34,770
Age is no guarantee
of efficiency.

323
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:37,285
And youth is no guarantee
of innovation.

324
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,345
Oh, how's it I can do more damage
on my laptop

325
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,247
sitting in my pyjamas before
my first cup of Earl Grey

326
00:39:43,272 --> 00:39:45,268
than you could do
in a year in the field.

327
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:46,951
So why do you need me?

328
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:50,538
Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.

329
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,159
Or not pulled.

330
00:39:53,664 --> 00:39:56,786
It is hard to know which
in your pyjamas.

331
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:05,415
- Q...
- 007.

332
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,920
Ticket to Shanghai.

333
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,173
- Documentation and passport.
- Thank you.

334
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:15,427
And this.

335
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,455
Walter PPKS,  9mm short.

336
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,334
There's a micro dermal sensor
in the grip...

337
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,203
It's been coded to your palm prints,
so only you can fire it.

338
00:40:27,984 --> 00:40:31,548
less of a random killing machine
more of than a personal statement.

339
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,559
And this?

340
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:37,415
Standard issue radio transmitter.

341
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:40,788
Activate it and it broadcasts
your location.

342
00:40:41,513 --> 00:40:42,758
Distress signal.

343
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:47,428
And that's it.

344
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:51,567
A gun, and a radio.

345
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:55,603
Not exactly Christmas, is it?

346
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:59,213
Were you expecting
an exploding pen?

347
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:03,022
We don't really go in
for that any more.

348
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,531
Good luck out there
in the field.

349
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,928
And please return
the equipment in one piece.

350
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:23,030
Brave new world.

351
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:44,576
Who's got the list.

352
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:51,585
Tell me, who you working for.

353
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,432
Tanner, he's posted
the first five names.

354
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:25,180
Their cover is blown.

355
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:27,884
They're in danger.
Get them out now.

356
00:52:07,184 --> 00:52:08,438
Room service.

357
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:18,942
I didn't order anything.

358
00:52:19,464 --> 00:52:20,600
Not even you.

359
00:52:20,843 --> 00:52:22,472
I have got some
new information.

360
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:26,723
Aren't you a little over qualified
to be delivering messages?

361
00:52:27,703 --> 00:52:29,839
It's all part
of the learning curve.

362
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:33,217
And Q is afraid of flying.
Of course he is

363
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:38,624
So, whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.

364
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:41,746
They posted the first five names
on the web.

365
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:45,187
- It was only a matter of time.
- That should be the start.

366
00:52:45,237 --> 00:52:48,579
They're posting five more
next week and the week after.

367
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:51,658
It's some kind of
sadistic game.

368
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:58,071
Cut throat razor.

369
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,504
How very traditional.

370
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:05,873
Well, I like to do some things
the old-fashion way.

371
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,808
Sometimes the old ways
are the best.

372
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,771
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

373
00:53:26,468 --> 00:53:31,089
Tanners, already briefed me
on the list...

374
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:36,627
raising the tantalising question
of what you are really doing here.

375
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,85
My official directive
was to help...

376
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,639
In anyway I can.

377
00:53:45,801 --> 00:53:48,549
Like spying for Mallory.

378
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,498
You know, Mallory
is not as bad as you think.

379
00:53:54,073 --> 00:53:56,218
He is a bureaucrat.

380
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,657
You should do your homework.

381
00:53:59,598 --> 00:54:01,520
Gareth Mallory
was Lieutenant Colonel...

382
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,772
Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland Herford regiment.

383
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:07,457
He spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

384
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,487
So there's more to him
that meets the eye.

385
00:54:14,638 --> 00:54:16,124
We'll see.

386
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:19,343
Keep still.

387
00:54:21,574 --> 00:54:24,174
This is the tricky part.

388
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:37,624
Now that's better.

389
00:54:38,479 --> 00:54:41,375
- You look the part now.
- Mmh, mmh.

390
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:45,052
And what part's that?

391
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:48,590
Old dog...

392
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,910
new tricks.

393
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,764
Good evening.

394
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:06,490
Evening.

395
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,602
Don't touch your ear.

396
00:56:09,689 --> 00:56:11,151
I've got three exits.

397
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:14,475
Lots of blind spots.

398
00:56:15,027 --> 00:56:16,949
I've got them covered.

399
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:24,251
You look beautiful
in that dress.

400
00:56:25,222 --> 00:56:26,454
You don't scrub up so bad yourself.

401
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,682
It's amazing what one could do
with an extra pair of hands.

402
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,592
You're telling me.

403
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,422
You gamble?

404
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,417
I like a little flutter
now and then...

405
00:56:39,403 --> 00:56:41,808
Who doesn't like
to take chances!

406
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:49,212
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

407
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:51,131
I'd like to cash this in,
please.

408
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:59,430
One moment, sir.

409
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:34,080
Good fortune tonight, sir.

410
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,377
Let's hope so.

411
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:52,205
With compliments of the house.

412
00:57:53,082 --> 00:57:54,669
Thank you.

413
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:16,802
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink?

414
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,886
Maybe I'll even stretch
to two.

415
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,168
I'm guessing I got 
4 million euros in here.

416
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:27,803
Not bad.

417
00:58:27,928 --> 00:58:30,854
- I like this game.
- Why don't we play another?

418
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:33,464
I don't gamble.

419
00:58:36,962 --> 00:58:38,630
I'm not very lucky.

420
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,478
Bit like our friend
in Shanghai.

421
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:48,351
I've been waiting to see
who'd redeem the chip.

422
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:52,575
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

423
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:54,878
Did I over complicate the plot?

424
00:58:56,011 --> 00:58:58,248
Who doesn't appreciate
the occasional twist?

425
00:58:58,716 --> 00:59:03,157
- Mr...
- Bond. James Bond.

426
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:06,734
Severing, so Mr. Bond...

427
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:10,206
shall we discuss your next
performance over that drink?

428
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:11,975
I'd like that.

429
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:18,135
Are your friends be joining us?

430
00:59:18,927 --> 00:59:22,140
That I'm afraid... is inevitable.

431
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:27,816
- She's pretty.
- Now, now.

432
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:30,902
If you like that sort of thing,

433
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:32,425
I'll keep you posted.

434
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:45,362
Perfect.

435
00:59:47,697 --> 00:59:50,388
Would you mind if I ask you
a business question?

436
00:59:51,974 --> 00:59:54,688
Depends on the question.

437
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:57,404
It has to do with... death.

438
00:59:58,305 --> 01:00:00,516
A subject in which
you're well versed.

439
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:03,349
How would you know that?

440
01:00:04,496 --> 01:00:07,404
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

441
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:10,436
with a Beretta 70
strapped to her thigh.

442
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:13,703
One could never be
too careful when...

443
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:16,706
a handsome man in tuxedos
carry Walthers...

444
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:22,176
I'm correct in assuming
you'll killed Patrice?

445
01:00:23,383 --> 01:00:24,565
Yes.

446
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:28,064
Might I ask why?

447
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,517
I want to meet your employer.

448
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:47,166
Be careful what you wish for.

449
01:00:47,664 --> 01:00:49,095
You're scared.

450
01:00:50,212 --> 01:00:52,241
Thank you for the drink...

451
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:55,392
Mr. Bond.

452
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:05,013
You put on a good show.

453
01:01:07,345 --> 01:01:08,793
But ever since we sat down 

454
01:01:09,015 --> 01:01:11,790
you haven't stop looking
at your bodyguards.

455
01:01:13,268 --> 01:01:15,529
The three of them's a bit excessive.

456
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,720
They're controlling you.

457
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:19,628
They're not protecting you.

458
01:01:21,817 --> 01:01:23,120
Tattoo on your wrist...

459
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:25,125
is Macao's sex trade..

460
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:28,286
You belonged to one of the houses,
what were you, 12 

461
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,452
13?

462
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:33,405
I am guessing he is using this as way out.

463
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,797
Perhaps you thought
you were in love.

464
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:40,842
But that was a long time ago.

465
01:01:42,964 --> 01:01:45,011
You know nothing about it.

466
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:49,005
I know when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.

467
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:54,200
How much do you know
about fear?

468
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:57,019
All there is.

469
01:01:57,824 --> 01:01:59,624
Not like this.

470
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:05,255
And... not like him.

471
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,764
I can help you.

472
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:10,371
- I don't think so.
- Let me try.

473
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:13,982
How?

474
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:16,668
Bring me to him.

475
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:23,006
- Can you kill him?
- Yes.

476
01:02:23,313 --> 01:02:27,012
- Will you?
- Someone usually dies.

477
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:35,022
Perhaps you can.

478
01:02:41,268 --> 01:02:43,281
When I leave,
they're going to kill you.

479
01:02:44,573 --> 01:02:47,274
If you survive,
I'm on the Kimera.

480
01:02:47,754 --> 01:02:48,941
North Harbour...

481
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:51,463
Berth 7.

482
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:56,007
We cast off in an hour.

483
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:02,732
Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.

484
01:03:04,384 --> 01:03:05,794
Good luck.

485
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:33,263
Good luck with that.

486
01:04:57,512 --> 01:04:58,670
Thank you.

487
01:05:03,379 --> 01:05:05,573
Put it all on red.

488
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:10,030
It's the circle of life.

489
01:05:33,957 --> 01:05:35,295
Yes?

490
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:41,994
It's time to cast off.

491
01:05:42,594 --> 01:05:44,034
Right.

492
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:42,041
I liked you better
without your Baretta.

493
01:06:45,809 --> 01:06:49,861
I feel naked without it.

494
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:05,965
Good evening.

495
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:07,832
The controversy surrounding
the Ministry of Defence...

496
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,415
has escalated today

497
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:13,330
as images of the Hussein
assassination continue to circulate.

498
01:07:13,587 --> 01:07:17,100
We should warn you, some viewers
might find these images disturbing.

499
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:22,061
Captain Hussein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East

500
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:25,803
was one of the five agents exposed
in what is now been considered

501
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,844
the greatest internal security breach
in modern British history.

502
01:07:30,115 --> 01:07:33,746
The Prime Minister continues
to express public support for MI6

503
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:36,104
while the opposition has taken
the position...

504
01:07:36,154 --> 01:07:38,723
has taken the position where a bunch
of antiquate bloody idiots

505
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:42,054
are fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.

506
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:44,680
Look, three of my agents
are dead already.

507
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,921
Don't embroil me
in politics now.

508
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:48,196
The Prime Minister
has ordered an inquiry.

509
01:07:48,558 --> 01:07:49,768
You'll have to appear.

510
01:07:49,817 --> 01:07:53,326
Standing in the stocks of midday?
Who is antiquated now?

511
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:55,528
For Christ sake, listen to yourself.
We are a democracy

512
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:58,060
and are accountable to the people
we are trying to defend.

513
01:07:58,085 --> 01:07:59,506
We can't keep working
in the shadows.

514
01:07:59,557 --> 01:08:01,894
There are no more shadows.

515
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,746
You don't get this, do you.

516
01:08:04,597 --> 01:08:07,501
Whoever is behind this,
whoever is doing it, he knows us.

517
01:08:08,194 --> 01:08:09,308
He is one of us.

518
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:11,425
He comes from
the same place as Bond.

519
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:14,007
The place you say
doesn't exist.

520
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,309
The shadows.

521
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:05,276
It's not too late.
You could turn back now.
I wouldn't be so sure.

522
01:09:41,747 --> 01:09:43,979
They abandoned it
almost overnight.

523
01:09:45,446 --> 01:09:48,837
He made them think there was
a leak at the chemical plant.

524
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:54,212
It is amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.

525
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,613
He wanted the island.

526
01:09:56,732 --> 01:09:58,639
So he took it.

527
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:01,811
Does he always get
what he wants?

528
01:10:02,968 --> 01:10:04,853
More than you know.

529
01:10:08,563 --> 01:10:09,783
I'm sorry.

530
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:41,138
Hello, James. Welcome.

531
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:42,989
You like the island?

532
01:10:46,563 --> 01:10:48,099
My grandmother had an island.

533
01:10:48,701 --> 01:10:49,825
Nothing to boast off.

534
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,907
You could walk along
within an hour.

535
01:10:52,146 --> 01:10:54,583
But still it was,
it was a paradise for us.

536
01:10:55,945 --> 01:10:58,154
One summer,
we went for a visit...

537
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:02,001
and discovered the place
had been infested with rats.

538
01:11:02,732 --> 01:11:06,244
They'd come on a fishing boat
and gorged themselves on coconut.

539
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:10,852
So, how do you get
rats off an island?

540
01:11:10,902 --> 01:11:12,122
My grandmother showed me.

541
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:15,846
We buried an oil drum
and hinged the lid.

542
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,139
Then we wired the coconut
to the lid as bait...

543
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:22,026
and the rats will come
for the coconut, and...

544
01:11:22,317 --> 01:11:23,804
They would fall into the drum.

545
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:29,144
And after a month
you've trapped all the rats.

546
01:11:29,389 --> 01:11:32,007
But what do you do then?

547
01:11:32,057 --> 01:11:34,060
Throw the drum into the ocean?

548
01:11:34,769 --> 01:11:36,917
Burn it? No...

549
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:39,178
You just leave it...

550
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:42,761
and they begin to get hungry.

551
01:11:43,627 --> 01:11:47,439
And one by one...

552
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,505
they start eating each other...

553
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:53,299
until there are only two left,
the two survivors.

554
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,889
And then what,
do you kill them? No.

555
01:11:56,555 --> 01:11:59,658
You take them
and release them into the trees.

556
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,622
And now they don't eat
coconut any more.

557
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:05,720
Now they only eat rat.

558
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:09,511
You have changed their nature.

559
01:12:11,454 --> 01:12:12,864
The two survivors.

560
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,104
This is what she made us.

561
01:12:18,137 --> 01:12:20,234
I made my own choices.

562
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:22,826
You think you did.

563
01:12:23,894 --> 01:12:25,456
That's her genius.

564
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:28,952
Station H.

565
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:31,548
Am I right, Hong Kong?

566
01:12:32,742 --> 01:12:34,866
'86 to '97.

567
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,802
Back then, I was her favourite.

568
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:39,729
And you're not nearly
the agent I was.

569
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:41,450
I can tell you that.

570
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,069
Just look at you.

571
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,265
Barely held together
by your pills, and your drink.

572
01:12:47,266 --> 01:12:49,922
Don't forget my pathetic
love of country.

573
01:12:52,003 --> 01:12:54,931
You're still clinging to your faith
in that old woman

574
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,312
- when all she does is lie to you.
- She never lied to me.

575
01:12:58,362 --> 01:13:00,233
- No?
- No.

576
01:13:00,406 --> 01:13:02,477
What do you score on your
marksmanship evaluation?

577
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,233
70.

578
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:06,530
40.

579
01:13:08,538 --> 01:13:10,808
Did she tell you the psychologist
cleared you for duty?

580
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:12,079
- Yes.
- No.

581
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:13,581
No.

582
01:13:22,191 --> 01:13:24,135
Medical evaluation; Failed.

583
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:26,170
Physical evaluation; Failed.

584
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:32,241
Psychological evaluation, alcohol
and substance addiction indicated.

585
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,577
Pathological rejection
of authority

586
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:38,882
based on unresolved
childhood trauma.

587
01:13:44,673 --> 01:13:47,313
Subject is not approved
for field duty

588
01:13:47,363 --> 01:13:50,559
and immediate suspension
from service advised.

589
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:52,664
What is this, if not betrayal?

590
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,570
She send you off to me,
knowing that you're not ready

591
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:56,794
knowing you will likely die.

592
01:13:57,229 --> 01:13:59,683
Mommy was very bad.

593
01:14:23,488 --> 01:14:25,567
See what she's done to you?

594
01:14:26,643 --> 01:14:29,917
Well, she never tied me
to a chair.

595
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:34,352
Her loss.

596
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:37,514
Are you sure this is about M?

597
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:39,256
It's about her...

598
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:42,428
and you and me.

599
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:45,679
You see, we are last two rats.

600
01:14:46,442 --> 01:14:48,358
We can either eat each other.

601
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:57,256
Or eat everyone else.

602
01:14:59,846 --> 01:15:03,376
How you're trying to remember
your training now?

603
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,476
What's the regulation
to cover this?

604
01:15:10,636 --> 01:15:13,033
Well, first time
for everything.

605
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,635
Yes.

606
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:19,728
Hmm. What makes you think
this is my first time?

607
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:24,726
Oh, Mr. Bond...

608
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:29,133
All the physical stuff's so dull.
So dull.

609
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,467
Chasing spies.

610
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:35,796
So old-fashioned.

611
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:40,699
Your knees must be killing you.

612
01:15:45,619 --> 01:15:46,797
England...

613
01:15:47,664 --> 01:15:50,117
The Empire, MI6.

614
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:52,358
You're living
in the ruins as well.

615
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:54,252
You just don't know it yet.

616
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:58,084
At least here there are no
old ladies giving orders...

617
01:15:58,294 --> 01:16:01,073
and no little...

618
01:16:02,327 --> 01:16:05,120
gadgets from those fools
in Q branch.

619
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:08,939
If you'd want it,

620
01:16:09,536 --> 01:16:11,914
you could pick
your own secret missions...

621
01:16:11,964 --> 01:16:13,890
as I do.

622
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:15,918
Name it.

623
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:18,859
Name it.

624
01:16:21,111 --> 01:16:25,638
You destabilise a multinational
by manipulating stocks. Easy.

625
01:16:26,574 --> 01:16:30,191
Interrupt transmission
from a spy satellite over Kabul.

626
01:16:30,226 --> 01:16:31,792
Done.

627
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:35,804
Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.

628
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:37,920
Or a gas explosion in London.

629
01:16:39,351 --> 01:16:41,429
Just point and click.

630
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:44,822
Well, everyone needs a hobby.

631
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:51,840
So what's yours?

632
01:16:53,186 --> 01:16:56,851
Resurrection.

633
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,681
Let me show you something.

634
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:16,050
Tells a story, doesn't it?

635
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,006
They left the island so quickly

636
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:25,041
that couldn't decide what to take
what to leave, what was important.

637
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:29,240
And this every day reminds me
to focus on the essentials.

638
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:33,457
There is nothing...
nothing superfluous in my life.

639
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:37,099
When a thing is redundant,
it is... eliminated.

640
01:17:47,483 --> 01:17:49,106
Fifty years old McCullan.

641
01:17:50,189 --> 01:17:52,760
A particular favorite of yours,
I understand?

642
01:17:55,082 --> 01:17:57,749
So... what's the toast?

643
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:02,697
To the women we love?

644
01:18:13,205 --> 01:18:14,139
Darling...

645
01:18:15,497 --> 01:18:18,439
Darling, your lovers are here.

646
01:18:23,725 --> 01:18:24,680
No, no, no, no...

647
01:18:25,746 --> 01:18:27,868
Stand up straight,
keep still...

648
01:18:30,016 --> 01:18:31,402
and whatever you do,
don't lose your head.

649
01:18:31,793 --> 01:18:34,642
Don't lose your head.

650
01:18:36,932 --> 01:18:38,533
Don't lose your head.

651
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:42,827
Time to redeem
your marksmanship scores.

652
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:45,762
Let's see.

653
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:47,866
You can be the first...

654
01:18:48,844 --> 01:18:51,643
to knock the glass
from her head.

655
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:00,113
And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.

656
01:19:18,177 --> 01:19:19,914
Let's see who ends up on top.

657
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:34,901
Oh, can't believe it.

658
01:19:35,544 --> 01:19:37,241
Can't believe it.

659
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,248
Did you really die that day?

660
01:19:39,945 --> 01:19:43,977
Is there any,
any of the old 007 left?

661
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:54,003
My turn.

662
01:19:57,532 --> 01:20:00,177
I win. What do you say to that?

663
01:20:03,759 --> 01:20:05,133
A waste of good scotch.

664
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:17,569
What are you going to do now?

665
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:20,192
Take me back to her?
All on your own?

666
01:20:20,805 --> 01:20:22,704
Who says I'm on my own?

667
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:43,361
Latest thing from Q branch.

668
01:20:44,656 --> 01:20:46,504
Called a radio.

669
01:21:41,857 --> 01:21:43,979
You are smaller
than I remembered.

670
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,444
Well, as I bet you remember
you were tall.

671
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:51,036
Strange, for me it feels just...
like yesterday.

672
01:21:52,948 --> 01:21:55,788
- Are you surprised?
- Not particularly.

673
01:21:55,871 --> 01:21:58,131
But then you always were
a slippery one.

674
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:00,736
Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.

675
01:22:00,786 --> 01:22:04,476
- You flatter yourself.
- No remorse.

676
01:22:06,302 --> 01:22:08,676
Just as I had imagined.

677
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:11,511
Regret is unprofessional.

678
01:22:17,744 --> 01:22:18,898
"Regret is unprofessional"...

679
01:22:19,186 --> 01:22:23,164
They kept for five months
in a room with no air.

680
01:22:23,214 --> 01:22:24,055
They tortured me.

681
01:22:24,822 --> 01:22:27,990
And I ain't protected your secrets.
I protected you.

682
01:22:28,973 --> 01:22:30,651
But they made me suffer...

683
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:32,292
and suffer...

684
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:35,356
and suffer.

685
01:22:36,503 --> 01:22:38,171
Until I realised...

686
01:22:39,917 --> 01:22:42,547
it was you... who betrayed me.

687
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:45,350
You betrayed me.

688
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:49,659
So I had only one thing left.

689
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:55,161
My cyanide capsule
in my back left molar.

690
01:22:55,211 --> 01:22:58,212
You remember, right?

691
01:23:01,358 --> 01:23:03,114
So I broke the tooth...

692
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:07,158
and bit into the capsule.

693
01:23:11,856 --> 01:23:14,018
It burned all my insides...

694
01:23:14,985 --> 01:23:16,511
but I didn't die.

695
01:23:20,006 --> 01:23:22,228
Life clung to me
like a disease.

696
01:23:27,224 --> 01:23:28,286
And then...

697
01:23:28,506 --> 01:23:29,934
I understood...

698
01:23:30,167 --> 01:23:32,275
why I had survived.

699
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:38,846
I needed to look in your eyes
one last time.

700
01:23:42,169 --> 01:23:44,318
Well, I hope it was worth it.

701
01:23:46,342 --> 01:23:47,533
Mr. Silva...

702
01:23:47,566 --> 01:23:49,830
you are going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison...

703
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,988
where you will be remanded
in custody...

704
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:55,892
until the Crown prosecution service
deem you fit to stand trial...

705
01:23:56,543 --> 01:23:59,040
Say my name. Say it.

706
01:23:59,058 --> 01:24:00,586
My real name.

707
01:24:01,815 --> 01:24:03,521
I know you remember it.

708
01:24:04,718 --> 01:24:09,011
Your name is on the memorial wall
of the very building you attacked.

709
01:24:09,788 --> 01:24:11,530
I will have it struck off.

710
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:16,780
Soon, your past will be
as non-existent as your future.

711
01:24:17,273 --> 01:24:19,182
I'll never see you again.

712
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:24,180
Did you know
what it does to you?

713
01:24:26,331 --> 01:24:28,622
Hydrogen cyanide?

714
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:43,883
Look at what you've done,

715
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:46,390
Mother...

716
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:26,615
Let's me know what you recover
from his computer.

717
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:28,591
Has he transmitted the list?
If such, to whom.

718
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:31,394
- I want this resolved.
- Yes, ma'am.

719
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,695
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

720
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:42,510
He was a brilliant agent.

721
01:25:43,398 --> 01:25:46,930
But he started operating beyond
his brief hacking the Chinese.

722
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:49,979
The hand over was coming up
and they were onto him, so...

723
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:51,135
I gave him up.

724
01:25:51,321 --> 01:25:52,813
I got six agents in return...

725
01:25:53,405 --> 01:25:54,988
and a peaceful transition.

726
01:25:55,013 --> 01:25:57,275
We should go, ma'am.
Board inquiry begins in 30-minutes.

727
01:25:58,282 --> 01:26:00,533
I want to know
what's on that computer.

728
01:26:13,363 --> 01:26:15,765
Now, looking
at Silva's computer...

729
01:26:16,499 --> 01:26:19,732
it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.

730
01:26:20,283 --> 01:26:22,103
He's established
failed saved protocols...

731
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:25,456
to wipe the memory if there's
any attempt to access certain files.

732
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,359
Only about six people in the world
can program safe guides like that.

733
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,522
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

734
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:34,074
I invented them.

735
01:26:37,261 --> 01:26:38,689
Right then.

736
01:26:40,087 --> 01:26:43,480
Let's see what you got for us...
Mr. Silva.

737
01:26:45,614 --> 01:26:47,286
We're in.

738
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:54,016
Sir...

739
01:26:54,245 --> 01:26:55,760
What do you make of this?

740
01:27:01,072 --> 01:27:02,696
This is Omega site.

741
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:05,628
Best encrypted level he has.

742
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:10,191
Looks like obsticated code
to conseal its true purpose.

743
01:27:12,052 --> 01:27:14,301
Security through obscurity.

744
01:27:15,744 --> 01:27:17,865
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order.

745
01:27:19,564 --> 01:27:21,393
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.

746
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:25,722
We are gathered today
to adjust some important issues

747
01:27:25,734 --> 01:27:29,191
concerning the future
of our national security.

748
01:27:34,703 --> 01:27:36,709
Going somewhere?

749
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,459
So you believe your stewards of MI6
during the recent crisis

750
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,821
has been up to scratch?

751
01:27:43,856 --> 01:27:47,249
Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party

752
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,775
undertaking all
the necessary steps

753
01:27:48,776 --> 01:27:51,805
to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.

754
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:54,764
Ugh! Such a job well done.

755
01:27:55,082 --> 01:27:56,794
I'm not saying
it all gone perfectly, but...

756
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:59,361
You forgive me for not
putting up the bunting.

757
01:27:59,831 --> 01:28:03,181
I find rather difficult to overlook
the monumental security breaches

758
01:28:03,182 --> 01:28:06,797
and dead operatives which you were almost singled handedly responsible.

759
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:12,326
He's using a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.

760
01:28:12,376 --> 01:28:14,910
Whenever I try to gain an access,
it changes.

761
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:18,313
It's like solving the Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.

762
01:28:23,538 --> 01:28:24,985
Stop.

763
01:28:26,573 --> 01:28:28,010
Go in on that.

764
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:36,295
Granborough.

765
01:28:36,342 --> 01:28:37,795
Granborough Road,
it's an old...

766
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:40,352
tube station
on the metropolitan line.

767
01:28:40,361 --> 01:28:42,272
Been closed for years.

768
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,906
Use that as a key.

769
01:28:56,744 --> 01:28:58,725
Now, look. It's a map.

770
01:29:01,152 --> 01:29:03,160
It's London.

771
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,659
Subterranean London.

772
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,671
What's going on?

773
01:29:08,721 --> 01:29:10,133
Why the doors open?

774
01:29:20,733 --> 01:29:23,432
Can someone tell me how the hell
he got into our system?

775
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:28,810
Oh, shit.

776
01:29:29,428 --> 01:29:32,014
Shit, shit, shit.

777
01:29:33,397 --> 01:29:35,977
He hacked us.

778
01:29:42,491 --> 01:29:44,100
Oh, no.

779
01:29:51,857 --> 01:29:53,139
Q...

780
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,484
He's gone.

781
01:30:04,695 --> 01:30:06,842
I'm on the stairwell
below isolation.

782
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,285
Can you read me, Q?

783
01:30:08,426 --> 01:30:10,396
I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.

784
01:30:21,057 --> 01:30:22,722
I've got him.
Tracking the location.

785
01:30:22,928 --> 01:30:24,108
Just keep looking forward.

786
01:30:24,956 --> 01:30:26,978
Enter the next service door
on your right.

787
01:30:33,575 --> 01:30:35,486
If you through that door,
you should be in the tube.

788
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,701
I'm in the tube.

789
01:30:39,299 --> 01:30:42,372
Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.

790
01:30:42,617 --> 01:30:45,296
He wanted us to capture him,
he wanted us to access his computers.

791
01:30:45,527 --> 01:30:46,446
It was all planned.

792
01:30:47,075 --> 01:30:50,294
Blowing up HQ,
only emergency protocols.

793
01:30:50,839 --> 01:30:53,044
And all we have retrieved
down here.

794
01:30:53,094 --> 01:30:53,977
I got all that.

795
01:30:54,707 --> 01:30:57,150
What it's got planned next
it worries me.

796
01:30:57,314 --> 01:30:58,579
The district line is the closest,

797
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,952
there should be
a service door on your left.

798
01:31:02,032 --> 01:31:03,834
Got it.

799
01:31:07,502 --> 01:31:08,448
It won't open.

800
01:31:08,548 --> 01:31:09,998
Of course it will.
Put your back into it.

801
01:31:10,008 --> 01:31:12,391
Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?

802
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:17,597
No, it's stuck.

803
01:31:18,366 --> 01:31:19,549
Oh good.

804
01:31:20,052 --> 01:31:21,859
There's a train coming.

805
01:31:26,059 --> 01:31:28,266
Hmm. That's vexing.

806
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,562
I'm through.

807
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:43,825
I told you.

808
01:31:44,386 --> 01:31:47,142
We've alerted security.
Police are on the way.

809
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:24,936
Where are you now?

810
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:26,771
Temple tube station.

811
01:32:27,022 --> 01:32:29,449
Along with half of London.

812
01:32:33,231 --> 01:32:34,289
Oh I see. Here you are.

813
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:37,178
I know where I am, Q.

814
01:32:38,114 --> 01:32:39,036
Where is he?

815
01:32:39,232 --> 01:32:41,666
Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.

816
01:32:49,673 --> 01:32:51,887
There's too many people.
I can't see him.

817
01:32:51,937 --> 01:32:53,436
Welcome to rush hour
on the tube.

818
01:32:54,281 --> 01:32:56,667
Not something you'd know
much about.

819
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,157
The train's leaving.

820
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:10,009
Do I get on the train?

821
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,216
Don't get on the train unless
he's on it. Give us a minute.

822
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:17,169
Do I get on the train.

823
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,482
- Bond...
- What?

824
01:33:24,816 --> 01:33:26,362
Get on the train.

825
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,686
He's keen to get home.

826
01:33:42,295 --> 01:33:43,864
Open the door, please.

827
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:48,259
Open the door.

828
01:33:51,241 --> 01:33:53,880
Health and Safety. Carry on.

829
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:03,314
- Where are you?
- Take a wild guess, Q.

830
01:34:03,928 --> 01:34:06,657
He's in disguise, now.
Dressed as a policeman.

831
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:30,433
Where is he going?

832
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,240
Where is he going?

833
01:34:39,209 --> 01:34:40,079
He's going for M.

834
01:34:40,201 --> 01:34:42,125
Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.

835
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,500
You overlooked
or chosen to ignore

836
01:34:44,693 --> 01:34:45,855
hard evidence...

837
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:49,596
and consistently,
almost obstantly...

838
01:34:49,878 --> 01:34:51,221
Silva has escaped.

839
01:34:51,732 --> 01:34:52,466
Bond's in pursuit.

840
01:34:52,717 --> 01:34:55,414
We need to get you to a secured
location immediately, ma'am.

841
01:34:55,496 --> 01:34:57,753
Like hell am I going
to show him my back.

842
01:34:58,046 --> 01:35:00,116
Are we straining your attention?

843
01:35:00,273 --> 01:35:03,891
No. Please, Minister. Proceed.

844
01:35:11,793 --> 01:35:13,255
Excuse me.

845
01:36:36,118 --> 01:36:37,768
It's as if you insist on pretending

846
01:36:37,819 --> 01:36:40,263
we still live in the
golden age of espionage,

847
01:36:40,313 --> 01:36:43,519
when human intelligence
was the only resource available.

848
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:45,982
Well, I find this rather
old-fashioned belief

849
01:36:46,246 --> 01:36:48,900
demonstrates
a reckless disregard for every...

850
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:51,283
Excuse me, Minister.
I don't mean to interrupt but...

851
01:36:51,371 --> 01:36:52,962
Just for the sake of variety,

852
01:36:53,743 --> 01:36:56,320
might we actually hear
from the witness?

853
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:58,874
Of course.

854
01:37:02,152 --> 01:37:03,906
Thank you.

855
01:37:32,123 --> 01:37:34,315
I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.

856
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,254
Not bad.

857
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:38,088
Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.

858
01:37:38,382 --> 01:37:39,943
Why, thank you.

859
01:37:40,402 --> 01:37:41,824
You caught me.

860
01:37:43,584 --> 01:37:46,723
Now, here's your prize.

861
01:37:46,773 --> 01:37:50,119
The latest thing
from my local toy store.

862
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:53,433
It is called "radio".

863
01:38:01,477 --> 01:38:03,305
I do hope that wasn't for me.

864
01:38:03,663 --> 01:38:04,707
No.

865
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:06,630
But that is.

866
01:38:58,323 --> 01:38:59,342
Chairman, Ministers...

867
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,815
Today I've repeatedly heard how

868
01:39:02,133 --> 01:39:04,547
irrelevant my department
has become.

869
01:39:04,722 --> 01:39:07,219
Why do we need agents
for Double-O section.

870
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:09,416
Isn't that all rather quaint?

871
01:39:10,296 --> 01:39:13,443
Well, I suppose I see a different
world than you do.

872
01:39:14,571 --> 01:39:18,049
And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.

873
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:23,482
I'm frightened because our enemies
are not longer known to us.

874
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:26,268
They do not exist on the map.

875
01:39:26,367 --> 01:39:28,218
They're not nations.

876
01:39:28,647 --> 01:39:30,086
They are individuals.

877
01:39:31,681 --> 01:39:33,571
But look around you,
who do you fear?

878
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,836
Can you see a face,
a uniform, a flag? No.

879
01:39:38,675 --> 01:39:40,792
Our world is not
more transparent now.

880
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:42,477
It's more opaque.

881
01:39:42,911 --> 01:39:44,687
It's in the shadows.

882
01:39:45,758 --> 01:39:48,092
That's where we must do battle.

883
01:39:49,098 --> 01:39:52,236
So, before you declare
us irrelevant, ask yourselves:

884
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:56,055
How safe do you feel?

885
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:02,117
Just one more thing to say.

886
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,364
My late husband was
a great lover of poetry.

887
01:40:05,781 --> 01:40:07,394
And, um...

888
01:40:07,444 --> 01:40:09,358
I suppose some of it sunk in,

889
01:40:09,383 --> 01:40:11,529
despite my best intentions.

890
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,478
And here today,
I remember this.

891
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:16,399
I think, from Tennyson.

892
01:40:19,007 --> 01:40:21,778
We are not now that strength

893
01:40:22,467 --> 01:40:25,180
which in old days
moved earth and heaven.

894
01:40:26,514 --> 01:40:28,460
That which we are, we are.

895
01:40:29,492 --> 01:40:32,499
One equal temper
of heroic hearts.

896
01:40:33,436 --> 01:40:37,590
Made weak by time and fate,

897
01:40:38,222 --> 01:40:41,316
but strong in will...

898
01:40:41,365 --> 01:40:44,702
to strive, to seek, to find

899
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:48,385
and not to yield.

900
01:42:11,028 --> 01:42:12,294
Move.

901
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:14,915
Move. Move.

902
01:42:54,723 --> 01:42:56,469
007, what the hell
are we doing?

903
01:42:56,585 --> 01:42:57,887
You're kidnapping me.

904
01:42:57,912 --> 01:43:00,176
That would be one way
of looking at it.

905
01:43:02,438 --> 01:43:04,840
Too many people are dying
because of me.

906
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:07,139
If you wants you,
he's gonna have to come and get you.

907
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,580
We've been one step behind Silva
from the start.

908
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:11,991
It's time to get out in front
and change the game.

909
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:14,570
And I'm to be the bait?

910
01:43:16,787 --> 01:43:18,245
All right.

911
01:43:18,822 --> 01:43:21,133
Just us. No one else.

912
01:43:22,091 --> 01:43:24,382
Q, I need help.

913
01:43:24,519 --> 01:43:26,314
I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?

914
01:43:26,594 --> 01:43:28,834
I got M.
We're about to disappear.

915
01:43:29,225 --> 01:43:30,163
What?

916
01:43:30,364 --> 01:43:31,521
I need you to lay
a trail of breadcrumbs

917
01:43:31,522 --> 01:43:33,823
impossible to follow
for anyone except Silva.

918
01:43:33,848 --> 01:43:35,347
You think you can do it?

919
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,631
I'm guessing
this isn't strictly official.

920
01:43:38,807 --> 01:43:40,151
Not even remotely.

921
01:43:40,322 --> 01:43:43,485
So much for my promising
career in espionage.

922
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,429
Well, I'm not hiding in there
if that's your brilliant plan.

923
01:43:54,430 --> 01:43:56,487
We're changing vehicles.

924
01:43:57,076 --> 01:44:00,366
The trouble with company cars
is they have trackers.

925
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:12,806
And I suppose that's completely
inconspicuous.

926
01:44:13,744 --> 01:44:15,187
Get in.

927
01:44:37,507 --> 01:44:39,347
It's not very comfortable, is it?

928
01:44:41,296 --> 01:44:43,134
Are you going to complain
the whole way?

929
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:45,043
Oh, go on and eject me.

930
01:44:45,093 --> 01:44:46,383
See if I care.

931
01:44:48,942 --> 01:44:50,188
Where are we going?

932
01:44:51,943 --> 01:44:52,860
Back in time.

933
01:44:54,068 --> 01:44:56,072
Somewhere we'll have
the advantage.

934
01:44:58,129 --> 01:44:59,258
It's a fine line.

935
01:44:59,861 --> 01:45:02,340
If a breadcrumb's too small
then he might miss it.

936
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:04,854
Too big and Silva
will smell the rat.

937
01:45:04,904 --> 01:45:07,774
That's what you think, even Silva
will be able to spot that?

938
01:45:08,147 --> 01:45:09,525
He's the only one who could.

939
01:45:12,438 --> 01:45:13,517
Sir...

940
01:45:16,514 --> 01:45:17,745
What are you doing?

941
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:19,177
We 're just monitoring...

942
01:45:19,427 --> 01:45:22,826
Creating a false tracking signal
for Silva to follow.

943
01:45:23,122 --> 01:45:24,262
Well, sir...

944
01:45:25,195 --> 01:45:27,086
Excellent thinking.
Get them isolated.

945
01:45:27,179 --> 01:45:28,985
Send him on the A9.
It's the direct route.

946
01:45:29,075 --> 01:45:31,194
You can monitor his progress
more accurately

947
01:45:31,579 --> 01:45:33,697
and confirm it
with the traffic cameras.

948
01:45:33,747 --> 01:45:35,824
But what if PM finds out?

949
01:45:36,931 --> 01:45:38,583
Then, we're all buggered.

950
01:45:39,148 --> 01:45:40,813
Carry on.

951
01:46:22,929 --> 01:46:24,405
Is this where you grew up?

952
01:46:25,627 --> 01:46:26,841
Mmhh...

953
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,298
How old were you when they died?

954
01:46:34,744 --> 01:46:36,668
You know the answer to that.

955
01:46:38,839 --> 01:46:40,763
You know the whole story.

956
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:51,786
Orphans always make
the best recruits.

957
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,548
The storm's coming.

958
01:47:59,534 --> 01:48:01,372
Christ...

959
01:48:03,635 --> 01:48:05,379
No wonder you never came back.

960
01:48:59,334 --> 01:49:00,750
James...

961
01:49:00,922 --> 01:49:02,594
James Bond.

962
01:49:02,644 --> 01:49:04,269
Good God.

963
01:49:05,721 --> 01:49:07,373
You still alive.

964
01:49:08,954 --> 01:49:11,329
Nice to see you too.

965
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,541
M... this is Kincade.

966
01:49:15,203 --> 01:49:17,499
A Game Keeper here since I was a boy.

967
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:20,338
- Pleased to meet you, Emma.
- Mr. Kincade.

968
01:49:21,808 --> 01:49:25,173
You're a tad late. They sold the place
when they thought you were dead.

969
01:49:25,238 --> 01:49:27,027
Seems they were wrong.

970
01:49:27,926 --> 01:49:29,189
What are you doing here?

971
01:49:29,661 --> 01:49:31,489
Some men are coming to kill us.

972
01:49:32,868 --> 01:49:34,430
We're gonna kill them first.

973
01:49:36,251 --> 01:49:38,599
Then we'd better get ready.

974
01:49:40,143 --> 01:49:41,647
Do we still have a gun room?

975
01:49:45,401 --> 01:49:49,897
They sold the lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.

976
01:49:50,009 --> 01:49:52,537
They were shipped out weeks ago.

977
01:49:53,154 --> 01:49:58,467
There's just your father's
old hunting rifle.

978
01:49:59,336 --> 01:50:01,520
We couldn't let that go.

979
01:50:07,417 --> 01:50:08,818
And this is what we've got.

980
01:50:10,363 --> 01:50:13,418
There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.

981
01:50:14,454 --> 01:50:17,956
But if all else fails,
sometimes...

982
01:50:18,448 --> 01:50:21,717
the old ways are the best.

983
01:50:26,773 --> 01:50:29,303
So, who is it we
supposed to be fighting?

984
01:50:29,734 --> 01:50:31,680
No "we" in it, Kincade.

985
01:50:32,288 --> 01:50:34,133
This is not your fight.

986
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:37,337
Try and stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.

987
01:50:39,008 --> 01:50:42,604
Now, remember what I taught to you.
Don't let it pull to the left.

988
01:50:43,924 --> 01:50:45,652
I'll do my best.

989
01:50:54,459 --> 01:50:56,752
What did you say
you did for a living?

990
01:51:12,113 --> 01:51:13,428
Emma...

991
01:51:14,299 --> 01:51:16,339
I brought you some things.

992
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:21,105
The nights get cold here.

993
01:51:21,967 --> 01:51:23,646
Thank you, Mr. Kincade.

994
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:26,636
It's a beautiful old house.

995
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:28,139
She is.

996
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:30,333
And like all great ladies,

997
01:51:30,915 --> 01:51:33,237
she still has her secrets ways.

998
01:51:33,912 --> 01:51:35,374
Let me show you this.

999
01:51:40,469 --> 01:51:41,644
A priest hole.

1000
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:44,070
Yes, from Reformation times.

1001
01:51:44,587 --> 01:51:46,234
The tunnel leads
under the moor.

1002
01:51:46,284 --> 01:51:48,986
If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.

1003
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,957
The night I told him
his parents have died...

1004
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,420
he's hid in here for two days.

1005
01:51:57,315 --> 01:51:58,860
But he did come out.

1006
01:51:59,403 --> 01:52:01,337
He was no boy any more.

1007
01:52:02,452 --> 01:52:04,517
We must get on.

1008
01:54:04,864 --> 01:54:07,140
I fucked this up, didn't I?

1009
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,813
No.

1010
01:54:11,608 --> 01:54:13,422
You did your job.

1011
01:54:18,586 --> 01:54:20,328
I read your obituary of me.

1012
01:54:21,988 --> 01:54:24,283
- And?
- Appalling.

1013
01:54:25,133 --> 01:54:26,843
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.

1014
01:54:29,159 --> 01:54:31,258
I did call you <i>'An example
of the British fortitude.'</i>

1015
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:33,582
That bit was all right.

1016
01:54:39,088 --> 01:54:40,405
Are you ready?

1017
01:54:40,414 --> 01:54:43,040
I was ready before
you're were born, son.

1018
01:56:03,323 --> 01:56:05,181
Welcome to Scotland.

1019
01:57:21,878 --> 01:57:23,716
You dropped something?

1020
01:57:49,955 --> 01:57:51,101
Are you hurt?

1021
01:57:51,143 --> 01:57:52,689
Only my pride.

1022
01:57:52,873 --> 01:57:54,697
I never was a good shot.

1023
01:57:59,619 --> 01:58:00,647
He's not here,

1024
01:58:01,627 --> 01:58:02,851
and he's not here.

1025
01:58:37,437 --> 01:58:39,608
Always got to
make an entrance.

1026
01:58:40,654 --> 01:58:42,526
You two, go to
the kitchen. Now!

1027
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,800
Go behind the yard.

1028
01:59:51,468 --> 01:59:53,582
Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.

1029
02:01:14,587 --> 02:01:17,750
Everyone listen to me.
Don't you dare touch M.

1030
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,343
She's mine.

1031
02:01:36,054 --> 02:01:38,447
Can your friends
come out and say 'hello'?

1032
02:02:45,207 --> 02:02:48,106
Come on. This way.

1033
02:03:45,313 --> 02:03:47,606
I always hated this place.

1034
02:03:57,647 --> 02:03:59,813
Are you getting warm?

1035
02:05:27,702 --> 02:05:29,723
Just make sure Bond is dead.

1036
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,590
Now it's me and her.

1037
02:07:33,544 --> 02:07:37,360
You see what comes of all
this running around, Mr. Bond?

1038
02:07:38,263 --> 02:07:40,943
All this jumping and fighting.

1039
02:07:40,969 --> 02:07:42,459
It's exhausting.

1040
02:07:45,876 --> 02:07:47,081
Relax.

1041
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:50,743
You need to relax.

1042
02:08:10,234 --> 02:08:12,197
Well, mother's calling.

1043
02:08:14,016 --> 02:08:16,436
I'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.

1044
02:10:35,429 --> 02:10:37,083
Of course.

1045
02:10:37,408 --> 02:10:39,128
It had to be here.

1046
02:10:41,695 --> 02:10:43,849
It had to be this way.

1047
02:10:44,896 --> 02:10:46,529
Thank you.

1048
02:10:46,687 --> 02:10:47,880
- I can't find it, though.
- No.

1049
02:10:52,227 --> 02:10:53,275
Please.

1050
02:10:54,019 --> 02:10:55,425
Don't.

1051
02:11:10,182 --> 02:11:11,775
You're hurt. You're hurt.

1052
02:11:16,733 --> 02:11:19,014
What have they done to you?

1053
02:11:19,498 --> 02:11:21,619
What have they done to you?

1054
02:11:53,836 --> 02:11:55,221
Free the both of us.

1055
02:11:55,903 --> 02:11:57,196
Free the both of us.

1056
02:11:59,025 --> 02:12:00,795
With the same bullet.

1057
02:12:02,067 --> 02:12:03,107
Do it.

1058
02:12:04,085 --> 02:12:05,370
Do it!

1059
02:12:06,862 --> 02:12:08,451
Only you can do it.

1060
02:12:09,281 --> 02:12:10,372
Do it!

1061
02:12:52,911 --> 02:12:54,445
Last rat standing.

1062
02:13:05,056 --> 02:13:06,707
007.

1063
02:13:06,769 --> 02:13:07,896
What took you so long?

1064
02:13:08,545 --> 02:13:09,545
Oh, I...

1065
02:13:09,546 --> 02:13:11,762
got into some deep water.

1066
02:13:27,356 --> 02:13:28,822
I suppose it's...

1067
02:13:29,782 --> 02:13:32,471
too late to hang around
and fret.

1068
02:13:38,394 --> 02:13:40,440
Well, I'm game if you are.

1069
02:13:50,633 --> 02:13:53,301
I did get one thing right.

1070
02:15:17,388 --> 02:15:18,336
Wow!

1071
02:15:19,891 --> 02:15:22,241
I didn't even know
you could come up here.

1072
02:15:23,431 --> 02:15:25,445
I hate to waste a view.

1073
02:15:25,495 --> 02:15:27,511
I can see why.

1074
02:15:29,307 --> 02:15:32,047
I thought you were going back
out on active service.

1075
02:15:33,463 --> 02:15:35,099
I declined.

1076
02:15:36,867 --> 02:15:38,320
You said it yourself.

1077
02:15:38,923 --> 02:15:40,913
Field works
not for everyone.

1078
02:15:41,814 --> 02:15:44,554
If it helps,
I feel a lot safer.

1079
02:15:49,943 --> 02:15:51,666
Her will was read today.

1080
02:15:52,717 --> 02:15:54,456
She left you this.

1081
02:16:06,477 --> 02:16:09,139
Maybe it was her way of telling you
to take a desk job.

1082
02:16:10,257 --> 02:16:11,852
Just the opposite.

1083
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:16,847
Thank you.

1084
02:16:35,397 --> 02:16:37,848
You know, we've never formally
been introduced.

1085
02:16:41,663 --> 02:16:43,372
Oh. My name is Eve.

1086
02:16:44,008 --> 02:16:45,573
Eve Moneypenny.

1087
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:48,798
I look forward to our time together,
Miss Moneypenny.

1088
02:16:49,394 --> 02:16:50,637
Me too.

1089
02:16:51,224 --> 02:16:53,854
I'm sure we will have
one or two close shaves.

1090
02:16:55,748 --> 02:16:56,910
Good morning, 007.

1091
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:59,852
- Good morning, Tanner.
- He will see you now.

1092
02:17:15,058 --> 02:17:16,284
How's the arm, sir?

1093
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:17,558
What?

1094
02:17:17,881 --> 02:17:19,260
Oh, it's fine.

1095
02:17:19,441 --> 02:17:20,721
It will get better.

1096
02:17:20,857 --> 02:17:22,301
All pretty shocking for someone

1097
02:17:22,302 --> 02:17:24,906
unused to field work.

1098
02:17:26,735 --> 02:17:28,575
So, 007...

1099
02:17:28,996 --> 02:17:31,122
Lots to be done.

1100
02:17:34,456 --> 02:17:36,641
Are you ready
to get back to work?

1101
02:17:38,295 --> 02:17:39,895
With pleasure, M.

1102
02:17:42,432 --> 02:17:44,030
With pleasure.
